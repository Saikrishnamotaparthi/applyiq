### üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Architecture

This project demonstrates a powerful, modern approach to building a "serverless" application using a visual automation platform as the backend.

#### **Front-End:**
* **HTML5, CSS3, & Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** No frameworks were used, ensuring a fast, lightweight, and dependency-free user experience.  
* **Hosting:** Deployed as a static site using **GitHub Pages**.  

#### **Back-End:**
* **n8n (Local Instance):** The entire backend logic is contained within a single n8n workflow running on a local machine.  
* **Google Gemini Pro:** The AI model used for the core analysis, accessed via its API.  

#### **How it Works:**
1. **Upload:** The user uploads a resume PDF and a job description PDF on the `index.html` page.  
2. **Request:** The browser sends the files via `FormData` directly to a dedicated n8n Webhook URL.  
3. **Process:** The n8n workflow is triggered and executes the following steps:  
   * Receives the files.  
   * Uses **Extract From PDF** nodes to read the text content.  
   * An **Edit Fields** node cleans and structures the text.  
   * A **Google Gemini** node sends a detailed prompt with the text to the AI.  
   * A **Code** node parses the AI's JSON response and shapes it into the final output format.  
4. **Respond:** An n8n **Respond to Webhook** node sends the final, structured JSON data back to the browser.  
5. **Render:** The browser's JavaScript receives the JSON and dynamically builds the beautiful results UI.
